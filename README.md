# SCR AUTOPILOT (beta)

works on version 1.9.6

"imagine exploiting in a train game" - a wise man

scr devs pls dont ban :very_very_sad_face:

you need to have window focused btw

So this is basically an autopilot/grinder. I tried to make the script as primitive as possible (no extra coding for an each station), so overshooting can happen.

What does it can do?
- Detect the red signal and stop close to it
- Stop at stations "perfectly"
- Stopping at terminuses (hopefully)
- Auto AWS (even though it is basically a Q spammer)

How it can stop at all the stations perfectly?
- calculation of a distance between a train and a signal, too lazy to explain it here

Is it allowed?
- No, it is an exploit

How can i run it?
- 1) download a lua executor (krnl, synapse...)
- 2) run it when you spawned in a depot

known bugs:
- morganstown connect terminus (ik why)
- benton waterline terminus broken (idk why)


btw, auto guard soon :)
