# SCR AUTOPILOT (beta)

a very bad cheat for this game: https://www.roblox.com/games/696347899/V1-9-Stepford-County-Railway?AssetId=696347899#ropro-quick-search

works on version 1.9.7

"imagine exploiting in a train game" - a wise man

scr devs pls dont ban :very_very_sad_face:

So this is basically an autopilot/grinder. I tried to make the script as primitive as possible (no extra coding for an each station), so overshooting can happen.

What does it can do?
- Detect the red signal and stop close to it
- Stop at stations "perfectly"
- Stopping at terminuses (hopefully)
- Auto AWS (even though it is basically a Q spammer)

How it can stop at all the stations perfectly?
- calculation of a distance between a train and a signal, too lazy to explain it here

How can i run it?
- 1) download a lua executor (krnl, synapse...)
- 2) run it

known bugs:
- morganstown connect terminus (ik why)
- benton waterline terminus broken (idk why)


btw, auto guard soon :)
